# Bankruptcy-Detector
The project "Bankruptcy Prevention" is a classification task aimed at predicting the probability of a business going bankrupt based on various features. Here's a brief summary of the project along with the deployment plan:

### Project Summary:
- Objective : To model the probability of a business going bankrupt using seven features.
- Features :
  1. Industrial risk
  2. Management risk
  3. Financial flexibility
  4. Credibility
  5. Competitiveness
  6. Operating risk
- Target Variable : Class (bankruptcy or non-bankruptcy)
  ### Model Building
  

### Deployment Plan:
- Acceptance Criterion : The end results must be deployed using Flask/Streamlit or similar technology.
- Milestones:
  1. Kick off and Business Objective discussion 
     - Start Date: 20-Feb-2023
  2. Data set Details & EDA 
  3. Model Building 
  4. Model Evaluation 
  5. Deployment & Preparation of Presentation 
     - Deployment includes deploying the model using Streamlit
  6. Presentation 

### Protocols:
1. Adherence to agreed timelines is mandatory, and timelines cannot be extended beyond the final presentation day.
2. All documentation, including the final presentation and Python code, must be submitted after the final review meeting.
3. Attendance at review meetings is mandatory for all participants.

In summary, the project involves building a classification model to predict business bankruptcy based on specified features. The model will be deployed using Flask/Streamlit, and all project milestones and protocols must be followed diligently.
